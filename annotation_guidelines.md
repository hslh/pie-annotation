# Annotation Guidelines

## PIE Annotation

A phrase is an instance of a PIE when the phrase contains all the words of the PIE, with the same part-of-speech, and in the same grammatical relations as in the dictionary form of the PIE. Determiners in both the phrase and the PIE should be ignored. Inflectional variation **is** allowed. Passivization **is** allowed. Internal modification of the phrase **is** allowed, e.g. the insertion of adjectives and adverbs. PIEs as (part of) proper names **are not** allowed. Transitive/intransitive variation of parts of the idiom **is not** allowed. Coordination of parts of the idiom **is not** allowed. Genitive variation (for idioms containing possessive pronouns or PPs) **is** allowed. The addition of tense, aspect, and modality markers/verbs **is** allowed.

**PIE**: *in the running* <br>
**Definition**: any phrase which has the preposition *in*, a form of the noun *running*, where *in* is the head of *running*. <br>
**Positive examples**: *in the early running, in the runnings, in running* <br>
**Negative examples**: *in a running competition, running in the woods, in a set of runnings, The magazine is called In The Running*

**PIE**: *spill the beans* <br>
**Definition**: any phrase which has a form of the verb *spill*, a form of the noun *bean*, where *bean* is the direct object of *spill*. <br>
**Positive examples**: *spill some very high-profile beans, spilling no beans, The beans were spilled all over the floor.* <br>
**Negative examples**: *three very high-profile bean spillings, the spilling of beans, The beans spilled all over the floor., I spilled beans and gravy.*

## Sense Annotation

Every instance of a PIE has to be labelled with the sense the PIE is used in, in that specific instance. We distinguish four different sense classes: *idiomatic, literal, unclear,* and *other*. The *idiomatic* sense is the one that is defined in the dictionary. The *literal* sense is the regular, compositional meaning of the phrase. Often, the sense of a PIE instance is clearly *idiomatic* or *literal*. In cases where there is some ambiguity, annotators should choose the sense that is most salient in their interpretation. The *unclear* sense should **not** be used for ambiguous cases, but **only** for cases where the clues from the context are not sufficient to disambiguate the sense. For some PIEs, there is no clear literal interpretation possible, e.g. *piping hot*. In those cases too, the *unclear* label should be used if there is no context, even though it is certain to have an idiomatic sense. In cases where neither of the above labels apply (see examples below), the *other* class should be used.

**PIE**: *rock the boat* <br>
**Idiomatic Sense**: to disturb the status quo <br>
**Literal Sense**: to sway a ship <br>
**Idiomatic Examples**: *I didn't want to rock the boat at my previous job, since I was leaving anyway., We needed a momentum shifter, we needed something to really rock the boat.* <br>
**Literal Example**: *The high waves rocked the boat, and I got seasick.* <br>
**Unclear Example**: *It rocked the boat., Rock the boat!*

**Illustration of the other class**: idioms embedded in bigger idioms, e.g. *on edge* in *living on the edge*, meta-linguistic uses, e.g. *the prototypical example of an idiomatic expression*, *spill the beans*, and other cases in which the sense is clear, but it does not fit the idiomatic sense of the PIE in question, or the literal sense of the phrase.

## Difficult Cases
* **Dashes**: treat dashes as spaces, and dash-joined words as separate words.
* **Coordination**: Treat these as non-PIEs. No clear reason for or against, just that a decision has to be made, and syntactic analysis of coordination is not trivial.
* **all over the place**: For the PIE 'all over the place', it is unclear what the distinction between its literal and idiomatic senses is. The main source of confusion is Wiktionary. The ODEI only lists in a state of confusion or disorganization. (informal). Mark cases where 'all over the place' is used in the sense of 'everywhere, in many places' as literal, and when it is used as 'untidy, confused, disorganized', mark it as idiomatic.
* **Genitive Variation**: We keep it as a PIE, because they are clearly idiomatic and a genuine form of the same PIE, and we want to keep as much data points and variations as possible.
* **Tense/Modality/Aspect**: We keep it as a PIE, because they are clearly idiomatic and a genuine form of the same PIE, and we want to keep as much data points and variations as possible.
